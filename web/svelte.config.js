/**
 * The console is a single-page app, and that is a security decision before it
 * is an architectural one.
 *
 * The session is an `HttpOnly`, `__Host-`-prefixed cookie bound to one origin.
 * A SvelteKit server rendering these pages would have to hold that credential
 * to fetch on the user's behalf — a second process with the keys to every
 * console session, for pages that are behind a login and cannot be cached
 * anyway. Building to static files that `otto-platform-server` serves on the same origin
 * as `/api` keeps the cookie in exactly one place: the browser.
 *
 * `fallback` is what makes deep links work. Every route below `/` is resolved
 * by the client router, so the server answers any unmatched path with the same
 * shell — `/o/acme/members` typed into the address bar has to load the app, not a
 * 404 from a static file server.
 *
