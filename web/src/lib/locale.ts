 * | Tier | Holds | Authority |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `users.locale` | the account's explicit choice, or `null` | **source of truth** |
 * | `localStorage` | a copy of it, for first paint | cache only |
 * | `navigator.languages` | the browser's preference | fallback when nothing was chosen |
 *
 * The stored choice lives on the account rather than only in this browser so it
 * follows the person to their next device. The cache exists because `/api/me`
 * is a round trip and, without it, every load after the first would paint
 * English and then snap to Spanish.
 *
 * **A locale change reloads the document.** Paraglide's `m.*()` are plain
 * function calls, not reactive reads, so Svelte has no dependency to invalidate
 * when the locale changes underneath them; the alternative is wrapping the app
 * in a `{#key}` and hoping every subtree re-renders. Somebody changes their
 * language roughly once per account, so the reload costs almost nothing and
 * removes a whole class of half-translated-screen bugs.
